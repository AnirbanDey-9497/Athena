## 🗄️ Database

### Schema
The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Key models include:

- **User**: User profiles and authentication data
- **Recording**: Video recording metadata and storage information
- **Share**: Sharing permissions and access controls
- **Comment**: User comments and feedback on recordings

### Migrations
Database migrations are managed using Prisma Migrate:

```bash
# Create a new migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

npx prisma migrate deploy

# Reset database (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### Database Management
- **Development**: Local PostgreSQL instance or Neon development database
- **Production**: Neon production database with automatic backups
- **Backup**: Daily automated backups with point-in-time recovery

## 🔄 State Management

### Redux Toolkit
The application uses Redux Toolkit for global state management. Key features include:

#### Store Structure
```
src/redux/
├── store.ts          # Redux store configuration
├── slices/           # Feature-based state slices
│   ├── auth/        # Authentication state
│   ├── recording/   # Recording session state
│   ├── player/      # Video player state
│   └── ui/          # UI state management
└── hooks.ts         # Custom Redux hooks
```

#### Key State Slices
- **Auth Slice**: User authentication and session management
- **Recording Slice**: Recording session state, controls, and metadata
- **Player Slice**: Video playback state and controls
- **UI Slice**: Application-wide UI state (theme, modals, etc.)

#### Usage Example
```typescript
// Using Redux in components
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { setRecordingState } from '@/redux/slices/recording';

// In your component
const dispatch = useDispatch();
const recordingState = useSelector((state) => state.recording);

// Dispatching actions
dispatch(setRecordingState({ isRecording: true }));
```

### State Persistence
- Redux state is persisted using Redux Persist
- Critical state is saved to localStorage
- Session-specific state is managed in memory

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@ep-something.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb"

# Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

# Other environment variables...
```
